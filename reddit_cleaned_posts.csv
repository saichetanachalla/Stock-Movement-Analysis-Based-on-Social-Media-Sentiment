Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined,"[https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/](https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/)

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.

>On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter.

>Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai.

"Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel","Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that replaces a flagging semiconductor company with the primary vendor of GPUs for AI.

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. In a separate move, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc in the average as well, S&P Global said in a statement.

Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180% so far in 2024 as investors have seen the company as the primary beneficiary of the AI boom.

On the other hand, Intel shares have fallen 51% so far this year as the company struggles with manufacturing, new competition for its central processors, and the impression that it has missed out on the AI trend.

The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of the companies total market value.

TSMC cannot make 2nm chips abroad now: MOEA,"Taiwan’s technology protection rules prohibits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, so the company must keep its most cutting-edge technology at home, Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo (郭智輝) said yesterday.

Taiwanese law limits domestic chipmakers to producing chips abroad that are at least one generation less advanced than their fabs at home. TSMC told investors in July its next-generation A-16 chip is to enter volume production in the second half of 2026, after ramping up production of 2-nanometer chips next year.

Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point,"**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html)

*The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy.*  
  
*In a follow-up to September’s big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.*  
  
*Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first “no” vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision.*  
  
*The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market.*  
*“The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the document stated, a change from September when it noted “greater confidence” in the process.*  
*Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much a priority as arresting inflation.*  
*On the labor market, the statement said “conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The committee again said the economy “has continued to expand at a solid pace.“*  
*Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank’s 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of “recalibrating” policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation.*  
*Powell will answer questions about the decision at his 2:30 news conference. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the presidential election.*  
*There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households.*  
*Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the Q2 level but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed.*  
*Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.*  
*The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop.*  
*President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday’s election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong.*  
*Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair’s term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead.*  
*An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts.*  
*Questions have arisen over what the “terminal” point is for the Fed, or the point at which it will decide it has cut enough and has its benchmark rate where it is neither pushing nor holding back growth. Traders expect the Fed likely will approve another quarter-point cut in December then pause in January as it assesses the impact of its tightening moves, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.*  
*The FOMC indicated in September that members expected a half percentage point more in cuts by the of this year and then another full percentage point in 2025.*  
*The September “dot plot” of individual officials’ expectations pointed to a terminal rate of 2.9%, which would imply another half percentage point of cuts in 2026.*  
*Even with the Fed lowering rates, markets have not responded in kind.*  
*Treasury yields have jumped higher since the September cut, as have mortgage rates. The 30-year mortgage, for instance, has climbed about 0.7 percentage point to 6.8%, according to Freddie Mac. The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost as much.*  
*The Fed is seeking to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy in which it can bring down inflation without causing a recession. The Fed’s preferred inflation indicator most recently showed a 2.1% 12-month rate, though the so-called core, which excludes food and energy and is generally considered a better long-run indicator, was at 2.7%.*

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1023,162,1732803922.0,reddit overtakes x popularity social media platforms uk rddt,reddit american online discussion platform overtaken x become fifth popular social media platform uk according communications watchdog ofcom said reddit users post discussion threads within topicbased communities visited million uk adults may year compared million x figures make reddit fastestgrowing large social media platform uk represent growth period leap took reddit linkedin x fifth place table uk social media platforms topped youtube overtook facebook reaching million adults reddit renowned devoted user base refer one another redditors appears boosted updates googles search engine year farhad divecha managing director ukbased digital marketing agency accuracast said googles latest algorithm update first half gave reddit big boost organic search traffic think probably contributed lot ofcom also speculated change may caused alterations thirdparty apps accessed content forcing users apps switch reddit site watchdog also flagged publicity around reddits stock market flotation march year popularity x also fell period according ofcom reach falling since may last year x criticised content moderation standards since takeover elon musk also faced competition since july threads rival x launched mark zuckerbergs meta ofcom figures featured watchdogs annual report nations digital habits revealed four uk adults say encountered misinformation deepfakes majority cases occurring online misinformation survey based poll uk adults also found three adults believe single group people control world together number believing significant evidence electoral fraud uk regulator also found onethird uk adults confident judging whether image piece audio video created artificial intelligence

&#x200B;

*Job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020 as the impacts of storms in the Southeast and a significant labor impasse dented the employment picture.*

*Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 for the month, down sharply from September and below the Dow Jones estimate for 100,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. In what had already been expected to be a downbeat report, October posted the smallest gain since December 2020.*

*The unemployment rate, however, held at 4.1%, in line with expectations. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.7%.*

*In the report narrative, the BLS noted that the Boeing strike likely subtracted 44,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, which lost 46,000 positions overall.*

&#x200B;

*Along with that, the report noted the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton but said “it is not possible to quantify the net effect” of the storms on the jobs total.*

*Elsewhere, the bureau said average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, slightly higher than the estimate, though the 4% 12-month gain was in line. The average work week held steady at 34.3 hours.*

*Markets, though, largely ignored the bad news, with stock market futures poised for a strong open on Wall Street while Treasury yields plunged. The meager jobs numbers along with wages about in line with expectations help cement another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.*

&#x200B;

*The release comes just days ahead of the presidential election in which Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in what most polls show to be a deadlocked race. With the economy at the forefront of the battle, the light jobs number “casts a murky shadow heading into next week,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.*

*The weak October report also included substantial downward revisions from previous months. August was cut to just a gain of 78,000 while September’s initial estimate came down to 223,000. Together, the net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals by 112,000.*

&#x200B;

*Health care and government again led job creation, respectively adding 52,000 and 40,000 positions. Several sectors, though, saw job losses.*

*In addition to the expected pullback in manufacturing, temporary help services saw a drop of 49,000. The category is sometimes seen as a proxy for underlying job strength and has seen a decline of 577,000 since March 2022, the BLS said.*

*Another leading sector, leisure and hospitality, saw a drop of 4,000, while retail trade and transportation and warehousing also reported modest declines.*

*The report covers a month in which hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeast – Florida and North Carolina in particular – while the Boeing strike also hit what had been a vibrant though slowing labor market. Recent developments indicate that the Boeing impasse, which sidelined some 44,000 workers, could be near an end.*

*Prior to the release, job creation had averaged close to 200,000 a month during 2024, about 60,000 below the pace for the same period a year ago through still indicative of solid pace of hiring.*

*Some cracks in recent months have raised concerns at the Federal Reserve that while the year-over-year pace of inflation is slowing, elevated interest rate could impact the labor market and threaten the ongoing economic expansion.*

*As a result, policymakers in September took a step unprecedented for a growing economy and lowered their benchmark short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, double the customary quarter-point increments in which the Fed usually likes to move.*

*Financial markets are pricing in a strong likelihood that the central bank cuts by a quarter point at each of its two remaining meetings this year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision next Thursday.*",929,152,1730464515.0,us economy added jobs october far less expected unemployment rate,us economy added jobs october far less expected unemployment rate xb job creation october slowed weakest pace since late impacts storms southeast significant labor impasse dented employment picture nonfarm payrolls increased month sharply september dow jones estimate bureau labor statistics reported friday already expected downbeat report october posted smallest gain since december unemployment rate however held line expectations broader measure unemployment includes discouraged workers holding parttime jobs economic reasons also unchanged report narrative bls noted boeing strike likely subtracted jobs manufacturing sector lost positions overall xb along report noted impact hurricanes helene milton said possible quantify net effect storms jobs total elsewhere bureau said average hourly earnings increased month slightly higher estimate though month gain line average work week held steady hours markets though largely ignored bad news stock market futures poised strong open wall street treasury yields plunged meager jobs numbers along wages line expectations help cement another interest rate cut federal reserve next week xb release comes days ahead presidential election democrat kamala harris republican donald trump polls show deadlocked race economy forefront battle light jobs number casts murky shadow heading next week said lisa sturtevant chief economist bright mls weak october report also included substantial downward revisions previous months august cut gain septembers initial estimate came together net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals xb health care government led job creation respectively adding positions several sectors though saw job losses addition expected pullback manufacturing temporary help services saw drop category sometimes seen proxy underlying job strength seen decline since march bls said another leading sector leisure hospitality saw drop retail trade transportation warehousing also reported modest declines report covers month hurricanes helene milton slammed southeast florida north carolina particular boeing strike also hit vibrant though slowing labor market recent developments indicate boeing impasse sidelined workers could near end prior release job creation averaged close month pace period year ago still indicative solid pace hiring cracks recent months raised concerns federal reserve yearoveryear pace inflation slowing elevated interest rate could impact labor market threaten ongoing economic expansion result policymakers september took step unprecedented growing economy lowered benchmark shortterm interest rate half percentage point double customary quarterpoint increments fed usually likes move financial markets pricing strong likelihood central bank cuts quarter point two remaining meetings year ratesetting federal open market committee announce decision next thursday
Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

Intel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading.

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*

*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",757,376,1730815541.0,musk says pointless build tesla human drivers,new car model tesla xb musk says pointless build tesla human drivers xb reuters reported april tesla scrapped plans longpromised nextgeneration electric vehicle automakers stock plunged chief executive elon musk rushed respond x socialmedia network reuters lying posted without elaborating teslas stock recovered losses six months later musk appears backed admission tesla dropped plans humandriven car said oct earnings call building affordable ev would pointless unless car fully autonomous latest remarks came response investor asking expect tesla give us nonrobotaxi regular car model musk responded making nonrobo interrupted another tesla executive musk later added basically think regular k model pointless would silly april reuters article reported tesla abandoned plans allnew affordable massmarket ev still planned selfdriving robotaxi since musk increasingly touted plans robotaxis autonomous vehicles tesla musk respond requests comment story october earnings call musk said tesla plan k car cybercab twodoor twoseat fully autonomous vehicle musk unveiled prototype hollywoodstyle event oct musk says tesla start production cybercab deploys fully autonomous versions current model model vehicles texas california next year automaker faces steep technological regulatory legal challenges delivering musks latest promises fully autonomous vehicles echo others dating back decade allnew affordable tesla human drivers recently linchpin teslas strategy become worlds biggest automaker several years tesla goal producing million vehicles year tenfold sells nearly double toyota current global sales leader may tesla dropped million goal latest impact report progress toward sustainability goals recently january year musk confirmed plan allnew affordable ev earnings call said nextgeneration vehicle would arrive launch second major growth wave following first wave release model model vehicles respectively investors tesla fans commonly called anticipated cheap car model slotting model currently leastexpensive tesla starting january musk described allnew model requiring new revolutionary manufacturing technology april reuters reported tesla scrapped model musk outlined plan affordable models could produced manufacturing lines current teslas seth goldstein morningstar research services analyst said believes lessexpensive vehicles built current tesla platforms priced mids understanding original plan make moreaffordable vehicle new platform told reuters think tesla realized late making affordable vehicle versus chineseev peers changed strategy rather make large investment produce new vehicle april reuters report tesla killed model musk posted day x saying tesla planned robotaxi unveil august event delayed october held movie set near los angeles underwhelmed wall street drove drop tesla shares following day investors viewed musks comments cybercab along displays autonomous robovan concept humanoid robots short concrete details products tesla hasnt said whether cybercab feature new selfdriving technology beyond companys full selfdriving feature current vehicles existing models cant fully drive require human driver paying strict attention target market cybercab isnt clear cybercabs sportscar looks twodoor twoseat configuration nearly extinct layout wider us auto market puzzled analysts expected robotaxi room passengers luggage musk october earnings call said concept vehicles design optimized autonomy would also deliver affordability cost roughly k k car musk said wont steering wheel pedals

The group is using Palantir's system to spot shortages and suggest solutions like placing an order from a supplier. Pete Suerken, who leads the purchasing co-op, said the system's AI learns over time and can suggest a specific warehouse, after considering factors such as cost and the probability of the items arriving on time. The software can predict when specific products will run out by analyzing current and historical sales figures.

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",520,174,1732271709.0,learnt mstr frenzy,long term investor mstr fact buying position presplit thesis much connected alternative investment vehicle bitcoin even though btc holding crypto exposure equity portfolio cut long story short bought mainstream etfs existing must admit sat loss one year mstr buying split adjusted longest time sitting range btc consolidating fine people understand mstr playbook bonds hedging btc already play long time lucky enough understand quite early bought quite early difference btc breakout companies looking method well eyes mstr multiplied exponentially fast forward one year fomo crowd arrived volatility learnt fomo arrived stock longer trading anything emotion speculation valuations matter anymore premium btc low less one year go reaching peak earlier week stock goes like crazy comes like crazy happens time exit nothing control much manipulation eg citron report social media mainstream coverage damn tweet really easy understand move point gambling held position level eventually stop losses triggered yesterday around level years mstr trade lesson learnt crowds arrive turn round walk away still believe mstr playbook come back front queue buying negotiated price bidding war gamblers

Volkswagen raises Rivian stake by 16% to $5.8 billion,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-volkswagen-group-launch-5-211929826.html

(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

Boeing starts issuing layoff notices as planemaker trims 10% of workforce,"Boeing said on Wednesday it is issuing layoff notices starting this week to workers impacted by a broader plan by the heavily indebted planemaker to cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global workforce.

U.S. staff receiving the notices this week will stay on Boeing's payroll until January to comply with federal requirements that give workers 60 days' notice prior to ending their employment. News that Boeing would send out the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) in mid-November was widely expected.

“As previously announced, we are adjusting our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We are committed to ensuring our employees have support during this challenging time.""

The notices come as Boeing under new CEO Kelly Ortberg is trying to revive production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX, after a crippling weeks-long strike by more than 33,000 U.S. West Coast workers halted output of most of its commercial jets.

"Toyota posts nearly 20% drop in second-quarter operating profit, missing estimates","Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

How we feeling about RKLB,"Pretty significant climb over the last few weeks. 305% YTD. Solid sales at $105 million. A couple rocket launches and it’s looking like we’re getting a Neutron launch in 2025.  

Right now the price is floating around $25/share. Pretty big jump fairly quickly, leaning towards “overbought”. Not sure if we should expect the price to climb any higher in the following weeks or if it’ll balance out around $20/share. But I feel pretty confident in this company and expect solid growth in the years to come.

Why is Buffet buying Domino's DPZ with -$112 book value?,"Just curious if anyone has insight, maybe an accounting background.  If you have read much about Warren Buffet you know other than his wealth, his claim to fame is value investing and his company's namesake, Berkshire Hathaway all started with a takeover of a company he found that was being traded at a significant discount to book value.

So I have to ask, how is he evaluating stocks now?  I saw that they took a decent stake in DPZ and look up the financials and note the company was trading for $430 per share with a book value of -$112 per share.  Obviously, not a lot of attention is paid to Book value these days by most investors, but this is one of the largest discrepancies I've ever seen between market price and book value.

Chris Wright - CEO of Liberty Energy and board member of Oklo Inc. tapped to be US Energy Secretary,"[Link to the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-names-fossil-fuel-executive-213214952.html)

>  
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",274,67,1731903761.0,trump team seeking ease us rules selfdriving cars,tsla overnight due news bloomberg members presidentelect donald trumps transition team told advisers plan make federal framework fully selfdriving vehicles one transportation departments priorities according people familiar matter new rules enable cars without human controls would directly benefit elon musk tesla inc chief executive officer trump megadonor become powerful fixture presidentelects inner circle bet future ev maker selfdriving technology artificial intelligence current federal rules pose significant roadblocks companies looking deploy vehicles without steering wheels foot pedals large quantities tesla plans trump team looking policy leaders department develop framework regulate selfdriving vehicles according people familiar matter asked named werent authorized speak publicly transportation department national highway traffic safety administration issue rules would make easier run autonomous vehicles act congress would clear way mass adoption selfdriving cars bipartisan legislative measure discussed early stages would create federal rules around avs two people said one candidate consideration transportation secretary emil michael former uber technologies inc executive spoken trumps team potential staffers said work early stages policy details yet determined said republican representatives sam graves missouri garret graves louisiana also considered lead department people said transition team didnt respond requests comment musk october announced plans produce large numbers driverless tesla robotaxis lack driver controls starting current us regulations pose significant hurdles musks plans socalled cybercab including cap limiting deployment supported federal rules autonomy teslas thirdquarter earnings call saying hed use role government push process allow autonomous vehicles used nationwide pronouncement prompted selloff shares uber rival lyft inc trump since named musk entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy lead new department government efficiency initiative dismantle government bureaucracy slash spending regulations deemed overly burdensome past efforts come federal legislation regulate autonomous vehicles stumbled nhtsa currently permits manufacturers deploy selfdriving vehicles per year granted exemption legislative efforts increase number many repeatedly failed bill sailed house several years ago trumps first term measure bogged senate attempt first year biden administration merge bill legislation faltered manufacturers tried include language would prevent consumers suing forming classaction cases
""" Boeing workers vote to accept deal, end strike ""","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/business/boeing-strike-vote-hnk-intl/index.html


New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

Vanguard deposes BlackRock as provider of world’s second-largest ETF,"Inflows to VOO look set to smash records as observers predict it will soon overtake SPY to become the biggest

Vanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.

In a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.

“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year. In contrast, SPY has seen $5bn in outflows. The $125bn gap between the two ETFs [VOO and SPY] has shrunk to under $50bn in 2024. Were that pace to continue, VOO would easily be crowned king in 2025.”

SAAB - Swedish arms manufacturer,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive.   
  
What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.  
  
I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet.  
Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products. [Products | Saab](https://www.saab.com/products) They are also designing their first drone at the moment. This is a really well run company, with a long history of building weapons, they are relatively small compared to other major players in the industry and just offers a very impressive range of products.

Will Nvidia suffer due to increased tensions with China?,"I want to be clear this is not a political post. Not looking for political opinions.

  
Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

  
2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

Nintendo cuts annual profit forecast 10% as Switch sales slow,">TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Nintendo (7974.T) cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 2025 by 10% to 360 billion yen ($2.36 billion) on Tuesday, as sales of its ageing Switch console lost steam.

I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027.

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.

The company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”

Netflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.

Recently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.

Beginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

When Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.

Netflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.

Netflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.

Media companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.

Netflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.

Netflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

What is pushing SOFI to a different stratosphere after it is up 54.64% in 1 Month,"Lower volume is usually expected today correlated with no Bond trading on this Veterans Day. With $13 Options in the Money this past Friday and the Option Chain bullish at $15 by the end of this week, it is possible to see a spike in SoFi stock today given the combination of Shorts%, Low volume, Options in the Money, and the positive sentiment from the bullish Option Chain.

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.

New York Times adds fewer digital subscribers as spending tightens,"New York Times posted fewer-than-expected digital subscribers for the third quarter as readers cut back on spending in an uncertain economy, offsetting strong growth in advertising sales.

The company added 260,000 digital-only subscribers, compared with 300,000 additions in the previous quarter. Analysts expected the company to add 280,200 subscribers, according to Visible Alpha.

Heightened political advertising in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election helped the company’s ad revenue of $118.4 million beat analysts’ estimates of $116.93 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It reported total revenue of $640.2 million, compared with estimates of $640.8 million.

New York Times forecast subscription revenues to grow by 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, slightly below expectations for 8.2% growth.

Revenue from sports news site The Athletic, purchased by the New York Times in 2022, jumped 29.8% to $44.7 million from $34.4 million a year ago.

S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.



S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.



Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable.



Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):

BlackRock launches ETF that expands beyond the ‘Magnificent Seven’,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/megacap-tech-gets-new-blackrock-etf.html


> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",148,62,1730466592.0,blackrock launches etf expands beyond magnificent seven,blackrocks ishares trying appeal investors want diversify beyond socalled magnificent seven firm launched ishares top us stocks etf topt month doesnt hold magnificent seven apple amazon meta alphabet microsoft nvidia tesla made largest us stocks market capitalization ishares build etfs designed deliver tool kit simple solutions investors able capture growth largest companies within us equity market today broader diversified manner blackrocks rachel aguirre told cnbcs etf edge monday aguirre firms head us ishares product noted etfs mission deliver easy accessible way tap innovation megacaps whether techheavy nasdaq space broadly within sp etf according aguirre provides way investors worried concentration magnificent seven stocks sp thursday magnificent seven slid group losing around billion market cap thats equivalent size jpmorgan chase however magnificent seven still far year sp around important clients investors remember split views topic many investors believe big get bigger winners continue win aguirre said theres also another side argument many investors believe actually worrisome time continue investing megacap companies high valuations
Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Lets talk pharma stocks,"If your not aware the entire sector has been selling off on the appointment of RFK jr for secretary of Health and Human services. Although he was nominated he still has to get approved by the senate, and the senate has big pharma supporting them. So whether he actually gets the position is to be determined.

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy. People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.

The whole sector is way oversold due to fear. Same fear that tariffs will destroy the economy.

"Intuitive Machines (LUNR) reports third quarter 2024 results, up 359% YOY, improved profitability with $4.1 million","HOUSTON, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intuitive Machines, Inc. (Nasdaq: LUNR, “Intuitive Machines,” or the “Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, “Intuitive Machines had a very strong third quarter highlighted by key wins, revenue growth, and the largest cash balance in Company history. Throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on our three core service pillars: delivery, data transmission, and infrastructure as services. These pillars provide foundational capabilities that enable the missions and goals of commercial and government exploration of the Moon.”

Q3 Highlights


Awarded $116.9 million contract through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, marking Intuitive Machines’ fourth contract award, more than any other CLPS vendor


Sole awardee of Near Space Network (NSN) data services contract from NASA with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion, a transformative step for Intuitive Machines in data transmission for in-space communications and navigation


Completed vehicle propulsion system hot fire for Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission, representing the most complex integrated test of the vehicle, in preparation for a Q1 launch from the Kennedy Space Center


Achieved $58.5 million of revenue in Q3, up 359% YoY; $173.3 million year to date, more than double all of 2023


Improved profitability with $4.1 million of positive gross margin in Q3


Ended Q3 with $89.6 million in cash, the highest quarter ending cash balance in Company history


Reported record backlog of $316.2 million, the highest quarter ending backlog in Company history driven primarily by Intuitive Machines’ fourth NASA CLPS award; backlog does not yet include the full $150 million of initial task orders for Near Space Network data services


Mr. Altemus continued, “We made progress across all three pillars by first securing another south pole lunar delivery mission, then winning the Near Space Network Services contract, and finally, continuing to mature both our LTV design in conjunction with our heavy cargo class lander. These strategic revenue streams bring our business thesis clearly into view, allowing us to focus on capturing more operational services, which we believe will provide long-tail revenues with higher margins.”

Intuitive Machines CFO Pete McGrath said, “As demonstrated in the quarter, we continue to execute on current programs while winning key awards. I look forward to guiding the Company through a new lens as CFO and focus on managing costs efficiently to drive towards profitability and achieve our financial targets.”

I think most of us are sitting on some capital gains but I’m thinking of doing some selling around Christmas as I hope we get a year end rally.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst. 

Any other thoughts?

E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Disney narrowly beats estimates as streaming boosts entertainment segment,"Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG

Earnings per share: $1.14 adjusted vs. $1.10 expected

Revenue: $22.57 billion vs. $22.45 billion expected

Disney’s net income increased to $460 million, or 25 cents per share, from $264 million, or 14 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring and impairment charges, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.14. 

Total segment operating income increased 23% to $3.66 billion compared with the same period in 2023.  

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks,  direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 14% year over year to $10.83 billion after a hot summer at the box office.

Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time this summer, surpassing Disney’s “Frozen II” at the box office. Meanwhile, its “Deadpool & Wolverine” became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, surpassing Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Joker.”

The films added $316 million of profit for the entertainment segment during the quarter. Overall, the entertainment segment reported nearly $1.1 billion in profit.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN’s profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, saw profitability improve during the quarter after turning its first profit during the fiscal third quarter, three months earlier than expected. The division reported an operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. 

Disney joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. 

Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. 

Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Meanwhile the company’s traditional TV networks business continued to decline as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. 

The experiences segment, which includes Disney’s theme parks as well as consumer products, saw revenue grow 1% to $8.24 billion. 

The domestic parks’ operating income rose 5% to $847 million, helped by higher guest spending at the parks and cruise lines. 

Operating income at the international parks, however, fell 32% due to a decline in attendance and in guest spending as well as increased costs. 

The company said Thursday it’s “confident in the long-term prospects for the business,” and provided an outlook that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Disney expects a “modest decline” in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter.

Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared to the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double digit percentage in its fiscal 2026.

Disney also anticipates double-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 for its entertainment segment.

The experience segment, however, is expected to see just 6% to 8% profit growth in the coming fiscal year compared to the prior year. Disney noted the fiscal first quarter will see a $130 million hit due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as a $90 million impact from Disney Cruise Line pre-launch costs.

During Disney’s fiscal 2025, the company expects high-single digit adjusted earnings growth compared to the prior fiscal year. The company expects double digit adjusted EPS growth in both fiscal 2026 and 2027.

SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase going into a much friendlier upcoming environment for financial institutions.,"SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase and its growth will dramatically benefit from the upcoming much friendlier environment for financial institutions:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price rises.
* There is a 97.4% chance of a 25 bp rate cut for this upcoming Fed meeting tomorrow, Nov. 7th. which would already meet the 75 bp cut that SoFi's CEO has predicted for this year to facilitate SoFi's rapid growth.

Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

RDDT Q4 prognosis,"Q3 was a big surprise due to DAU skyrocketing and ads $ following. The stock went up huge and has kept most of those gains post-earnings release, notwithstanding the recent 15-20% slump.

Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/26),"# I'm back.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Note: This analysis is based on publicly available information and market conditions as of the report date. Please conduct your own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.

I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.

I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.

I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.

Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.

Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.

The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.

As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!

I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.

Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.

Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.

For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.

I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?

And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.

I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.

Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.

The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.

Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges

"PCE rises to 2.3% annually, ""meeting expectations""","I'm surprised the market has been taking this in stride. Although this data is ""meeting expectations"", it does paint a picture of sticky inflation and with the incoming tariffs why isn't the market more negative? Are people just out of office already?

* Spending rose 0.4% on the month, as forecast, while personal income jumped 0.6%, well above the 0.3% estimate.

"Robotics, Cyber-Security, Beverage and Industrial Stocks ","I wanted to buy some individual stocks today from 4 different industries. After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me.

Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",58,11,1732197326.0,palo alto networks beats q estimates shares fall billings decline bod approves stock split,quarter ended october palo alto networks reported adjusted earnings per share versus consensus estimate revenue totaled b versus estimate b quarter progress palo alto networks expects adjusted earnings per share range midpoint matches estimate revenue projection second quarter ranges b b represents growth year year midpoint b comes estimate b second quarter nextgeneration security arr expected range b b would represent yearoveryear increase total revenue fiscal year runs august july expected range b b would represent growth year year platformization progress continued q driving strong financial results said dipak golechha chief financial officer palo alto networks result raising ngs arr revenue nongaap eps guidance year board directors also approved twoforone stock split increase number authorized common shares b b trading splitadjusted basis expected begin dec ive big fan panw last years billings decline isnt great expected company pushes platformization anticipate great long term outlook short term may seem like growth slowing platformization make services sticky harder companies leave theyll integrated across business across multiple levels although im big fan stock admit expensive one lot hinges future growth whole industry signs slowed growth think one hurt investors buying levels im cybersecurity im sure likelihood id keep eye ive made several posts panw last year consensus continue buy monthly theres large pull back ill look make large purchase cash reserves

$Dell Earnings ,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

Why do shareholders of a company with positive shareholder equity still receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy?,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently looking at the situation with Spirit Airlines. I’m not a shareholder, but I was interested in the fact that they report about $807m in shareholder equity.

Spirit now claim that the bonds due in 2025 and 2026 are a problem, and they must renegotiate, likely resulting in a wipeout of shareholders and Chapter 11.

My question is, if the company has equity value remaining, why do the shareholders end up with nothing? Is it because the value of those assets would likely not stack up to the value of liabilities when liquidated/sold off (although I would assume depreciation accounts for that)? Or is it because the costs incurred during the bankruptcy process would exceed the shareholder equity in the company?

I can’t imagine the process would cost them $807m…

 Summary:

ELF was founded in 05, fast fashion beauty brand, with the success of the new media marketing in the past few years, the brand influence has increased greatly, after 21 years, the average 50% increase in revenues, the market capitalization is also soaring, soaring from $500 million to $12 billion, back to $7.3 billion now.

The biggest problem with fast fashion brands is that they tend to rise fast and fall fast; to form a brand moat, they still need more than a decade of precipitation.

So the observation of ELF is mainly to see whether its hotness in the United States can be sustained, as well as the development of overseas markets;

Overall, fast fashion beauty, because of its low technology and high profit, belongs to the products that need strong marketing, and it is considered a good idea to use new media + Netflix as the main marketing method.",52,23,1731339560.0,elf unlimited potential sharply today,us elf beauty founded mainly affordable fastfashion makeup epidemic suddenly became popular us make market value wildly million early maximum billion march lowerthanexpected earnings report management lowered guidance predicting year growth slowed years percent november market cap billion nutshell b market cap elf unlimited potential future growth company business main category color cosmetics latest signature product soft glam satin foundation also skin care products share low main focus costeffective light operation us design china manufacturing thirdparty production revenue region us market accounts international market us mainly relies walmart target cvs ulta beauty channels sales elf currently available countries distributes globally mainly eshopworld revenue channel retailers occupy ecommerce channel main reasons success oem china reduces cost gross margin creates costeffective selling points responds quickly new products taking weeks rd launch new media netizen cooperation influential social media like tiktok instagram develops marketing content separately according different social media attributes pushing new products crossbranding many brands jeans fast food restaurants etc novelty fast fashion new media marketing approach making popular among teenagers represented generation z ranks top three terms market share cosmetics may refer united states alone brand awareness rising rapidly within us elfs brand awareness increased fourth largest brand uk canada compared eighth sixth respectively year ago company strategy costeffective products new media marketing lowcost channels executives shareholdings predominantly institutional holdings relatively diversified pioneer pilot percent blackrock percent berkey investments percent ceo joined served ceo prior track record experience variety industries cfo vp joined position also previously beauty industry march fulltime employees including china financial income statement revenue fiscal year billion gross profit million selling administrative expenses million net income million revenue fiscal year order billion revenue increases fy fy order net income fiscal years order million cash flow statement operating cash flow billion free cash flow billion basically financing since ipo billion buybacks august said board directors authorized million buybacks balance sheet end march total assets billion total liabilities million shareholders equity close million debt ratio among assets cash assets million inventory million fixed assets billion goodwill intangibles billion liability side interestbearing liabilities million short long financial position good valuation current market capitalization billion us dollars corresponding annual revenue billion per year spending million per year sale management costs get million profit free cash flow assets books million cash million liabilities shareholders equity million goodwill intangible assets market views short side us canadian markets close saturation elf certain categories ranked one two like previous substantial growth unlikely international market vast space development estimated us market achieved highspeed expansion industry ev ebitda valuation growth generally times elf years respectively multiple parties international market great potential fy revenues reach billion billion given valuation times pe ratio target share price summary elf founded fast fashion beauty brand success new media marketing past years brand influence increased greatly years average increase revenues market capitalization also soaring soaring million billion back billion biggest problem fast fashion brands tend rise fast fall fast form brand moat still need decade precipitation observation elf mainly see whether hotness united states sustained well development overseas markets overall fast fashion beauty low technology high profit belongs products need strong marketing considered good idea use new media netflix main marketing method

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

How is this influencing your investment decisions?",50,44,1732300870.0,putting much faith generative ai could hurt ai investments broadly,obviously lot money made airelated stocks im one lucky investors part reason fear general ai bubble many discussed rather generative ai bubble id appreciate hearing others feel right far bulk investment focused generative ai especially llms nvda near center thanks gpus meanwhile alternative ai approaches eg neuromorphic computing symbolic ai reinforcement learning hybrid models getting far less attention problem impressive may seem generative ai significant inherent drawbacks factually unreliable outputs cant reliably distinguish fact fiction probabilistic reasoning true causal understanding high computational costs questionable sustainability limited realworld problemsolving abilities point reality generative ais limitations become apparent enough investors could see ai market correction even collapse would hurt ai stocks like nvda could also starve funding alternative ai approaches longterm potential yet largely overlooked think influencing investment decisions
Is now the time to bet big on small caps IWM / XSMO or stick with VOO? What about mid-cap (IVOG)?,"I’m planning to rebalance my portfolio by pulling a chunk out of my HYSA to invest in the market. 

I started listening to Tom Lee last December, and for many things, I’m thankful.  However,  he’s been calling for small-cap rotation all year, and now he’s saying they will potentially “outperform by more than 100%” over the next couple of years because they’re trading at a discount relative to large caps. 

After some basic research earlier this year, I divided my investments between VOO (S&P 500), IWM (Russell 2000), XSMO (Momentum Small Cap), and IVOG (Mid Cap).  So far, VOO would have been better. 

I’m typically a long-term investor.  Would I be better off sticking with the tried-and-true VOO or continuing to diversify with small caps? And how does mid-cap IVOG fit into this mix?

Burger King parent Restaurant Brands falls short of Q3 revenue expectations,"Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as domestic same-store sales growth for all four of its chains fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

Healthcare company with a MOAT ?,"Hey all,

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

If you yourself know of companies within the healthcare sector who has a moat I'd love to hear it. Or if there's any healthcare company you have in your portfolio let me know. I'll be doing my own valuation & analysis but suggestions are more than welcomed.",41,70,1730654875.0,healthcare company moat,hey ive diving deep healthcare defense sector late found defense much easier understand former military member dealt directly products however healthcare sector tricky one hand look kvue strong branding like tylenol less attractive valuation single digit growth projections left searching elsewhere issue see dont find anyone moat novo nordisq appealing ive gathered market share lot product compromised rather quickly ozempic strong product secure product found niche eye care senior living reits nothing quite attracted know companies within healthcare sector moat id love hear theres healthcare company portfolio let know ill valuation analysis suggestions welcomed
Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",43,149,1732197702.0,investors looking european markets,let preface saying live europe dabbling initially companies closer home switched us markets due higher historical returns hindsight excellent decision almost investments spnasdaq outperformed ones listed europe american guys look european markets see opportunity create alpha bullish eu markets theres argument made potentially investing eu serves way diversify lower exposure us markets find hard find good european companies solid fundamentals good stock performance could myriad reasons including liquidity slower growth regulation government oversight personally three companies still portfolio eu markets rr nvo lvmh lvmh slowing likely due luxury market turmoil exposure china additionally nvo listed nyse uptil recently performed rather well finally question guys actively eschewing american markets european ones actively increasing allocation would love know rationale importantly particular industries geographies youre targeting
Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

How has Walgreens not cut their dividend yet?,"I have never held a position in WBA but I do follow the stock. After the beating they took throughout the year, the missed earning and the store closures, I figured it was a certainty they would cut their dividend.

TSMC Predictions,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis:

  
1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD.

PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more.

Chipotle Mexican Grill names Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday named interim boss Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO of the burrito chain in a widely expected move, months after Brian Niccol exited the role to take the top job at Starbucks.

Boatwright, who has been at Chipotle since 2017, takes the helm as restaurants across the United States battle weak consumer demand in the face of higher menu prices.

In a surprise announcement in August, Starbucks named Niccol as its new CEO, leaving Chipotle under Boatwright, who has vowed to push the burrito chain to be a “global lifestyle brand” and expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America.

A veteran in the restaurant industry, Boatwright spent 18 years with Arby’s Restaurant Group before joining Chipotle in 2017.

He was named CEO following “a thorough and rigorous external search process,” Chipotle said in a statement on Monday.

Boatwright worked closely with Niccol to also steer the company out of a crisis following a severe E. coli and salmonella outbreak in 2015.

“Boatwright was by far the most logical choice given his instrumental role in leading Chipotle’s efforts to improve operations, integrate new technology, reduce employee turnover, and bolster customer satisfaction,” said Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair.

His appointment as CEO comes amid a slew of changes to the top brass at Chipotle following Niccol’s exit. 

In August, Chipotle also accelerated the appointment of Adam Rymer as its chief financial officer, and named Rymer’s predecessor Jack Hartung as chief strategy officer.

Hartung was originally set to retire in March next year after a little over two decades as the company’s CFO. Rymer has been at Chipotle for 15 years, last serving as vice president of finance. 

“Boatwright as CEO should build confidence among investors in Chipotle’s management,” said Jim Sanderson, analyst at Northcoast Research. 

Chipotle’s stock lost $6 billion in market value immediately after Niccol’s departure. Since then, shares have risen about 14%.

Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Thoughts? (Thanks in advance for your opinion)

Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Deep dive into Cal-Maine - Cracking the shell: The complex World of Eggs,"**1.0 Introduction**

Every once in a while, I stumble upon a company that seems simple, yet, turns out to be incredibly complex. Cal-Maine is one that fits this description.

It is the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. (market share of \~14.5%), and its closest competitor is almost half its size.

Based on the description, one would expect that this is a relatively simple company. I mean, **it only sells eggs, right?**

What if I told you that the management has very little control over a business of this kind? There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s get started.

  
**2.0 The eggs**

In theory, the revenue generated would be equal to the **number of eggs sold** multiplied by the **average egg price**. So let’s have a look at these two variables:

Cal-Maine sells two types of eggs:

* **Specialty** \- These encompass a broad range of products, such as cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs.
* **Conventional** \- all other shell eggs

Why is this important? The specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers. Unlike conventional, where the wholesale prices are volatile.

In 2024, the company sold 12% more dozens than back in 2018. This is more impressive than it sounds, as this is not a growing market. The demand for eggs is relatively stable, in fact, and it only grows with an increase in population. This indicates the company has slightly increased its market share during this time. To illustrate how stable the sales were in terms of volume, the 12% increase from 2018 to 2024 came without any down year.

But more importantly, the composition has changed. In 2018, about 244m dozens of specialty eggs were sold. This number increased to 401m in 2024 (**+64%**)! The % of specialty eggs of the total eggs sold increased from 24% to 35%.

Here are the prices from 2018 to 2024:

Conventional: $1.23 --> $1.04 --> $0.98 --> $0.98 --> $1.42 --> $2.73 --> $1.73

Specialty: $1.92 --> $1.93 --> $1.88 --> $1.88 --> $1.93 --> $2.40 --> 2.31

The specialty eggs are not only more expensive, but the price is significantly more stable.  Well, except for 2023. What was that about? Why were conventional eggs more expensive?

The answer is **HPAI**, known as “**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**” which is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. When there is an HPAI outbreak, there is a significant decrease in supply, which pushes the price up. This is unpredictable, and the only way to deal with this is to mitigate the risk by having multiple locations, something that Cal-Maine has.

  
The volatility of egg prices ***(per dozen)*** is significant, so despite the volume of dozens sold being stable, it is impossible to forecast the revenue of the company over time, given the volatility of the prices. But this is just the start.



**3.0 The direct costs**

The largest direct cost relates to feed. The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility.

**So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in.

This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view.

Over the last decade:

\- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.**

\- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.**

  
**4.0 Now what?**

So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens.

For that reason, the company has **no debt**.

In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to?

* **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers.
* **Investment securities** \- Mostly U.S. Government and agency obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.

I do think that the management does a good job, but the uncertainty scares away many investors.

  
**5.0 Other important topics**

**5.1 Walmart**

About 89% of the total revenue relates to sales to retail customers and 11% to food service providers.

**Walmart (including Sam’s Club)** is a major customer, accounting for 34% of its revenue. Although this might be perceived as a risk by many, I’d argue that is one of the biggest strengths the company has. Walmart has no alternative, as no competitor can quickly jump in to replace Cal-Maine.

**5.2 The special shares**

The company has two types of shares:

* **Common** (trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol $CALM- 44.2m shares outstanding
* **Class A** \- 4.8m shares outstanding, owned by an LLC

So, why are there two types of shares? Although both of them have the same rights in terms of dividends and liquidation, each class A shares is entitled to **10 votes.**

This means the class A shareholders have **52% voting rights.**

**6.0 Valuation**

So, how does one value a company of this kind when not only there are many pieces of the puzzle, but the pieces are changing?

Does a DCF make sense? Not really. There is no point attempting to forecast the next 5 or 10 years, when the next 2 are uncertain.

I’d argue that this is a company that could be treated like a bond, where the coupon is fluctuating, and a dividend discount model would be an appropriate way to value it. Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use FCF - SBC.

  
So, how to estimate the FCF? There will always be good and bad years in a company of this kind. So using the average of the last decade would be a good place to start.

  
FCF - SBC: $180m

Growth in perpetuity: 8%

Discount rate: 9%

Value of the business: $3 billion

\+ Cash: $182m

\+ Non-operating assets: $539m

\- Value of equity options: $12

**Value of the company: $3.7 billion ($76/share)**

This is slightly lower than the current market cap of **$4.6 billion ($91/share)**.



So, anyone who is betting on Cal-Maine is ultimately betting that:

1. The egg market will remain stable, from a volume point of view - **which is very likely**
2. The future prices (eggs, corn, soybeans) will be slightly more favorable on average than the past prices - **which is uncertain**
3. Walmart will remain a key customer - **which is likely**
4. There will be no significant HPAI outbreak that will harm Cal-Maine - **which is uncertain**
5. The class A shareholders votes will be in the interest of all shareholders - given the past decisions, **this is likely**
6. The management will continue to run the company safely, without any significant debt position - **which is likely**

Based on the list above, there are two uncertainties, prices and HPAI outbreaks. Quite a lot to digest, for such a “simple” business. It’s only eggs, right?

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.

Lost in translation (RR CEZ),"Hello, I believe opportunity to beat the market is in finding market ineffectiveness. How much market ineffectiveness do you believe, there is in different information availability between languages?

Why I am asking.

Last week ČEZ has bought 20% of Rolls Royce SMR. And it was massive event in Czech language. Largest net newspaper had article about it on the front page. (remainder google translate can translate web-pages if you want to read).

Largest newspaper article: https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/ekonomika-firmy-cez-koupi-za-miliardy-podil-v-rolls-royce-smr-budou-vyrabet-reaktory-263383

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

What is your opinion? Have there been any misdirection from ASML or is this frivolous?

"Thoughts on Big Tobacco (MO, PM, BTI) these next 4 years?","What the title says. Big Tobacco donated more to republicans than democrats, though one notable exception was BTI donating disproportionately highly to black democrats due to their opposition to Biden's (scrapped) menthol ban.

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Lyft Achieves Record-Breaking Q3 2024 with Surge in Riders and Revenue,"I added more Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) shares this morning at $17.50 following their excellent Q3-2024 results. I had first started buying Lyft last month at $13.50.

Lyft demonstrated remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2024, posting significant gains in both operational metrics and financial performance. The rideshare giant reported record-breaking numbers in active riders and total rides, while substantially improving its financial position through increased revenue and robust cash flow generation.

# STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

**Excellent revenue, EBITDA and Cash Flow growth** 

* **Gross Bookings**: Reached $4.1 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase
* **Revenue**: Hit $1.5 billion, showing substantial growth of 32% year-over-year
* **Net Loss**: Posted $(12.4) million, including a $36.4 million restructuring charge
* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Achieved $107.3 million, up from $92.0 million in Q3'23
* **Free Cash Flow**: Generated $242.8 million, a significant improvement from $(30.0) million in Q3'23

**Solid Operational Achievements**

The company set new records in its core operational metrics:

* Reached 24.4 million Active Riders (9% YoY growth)
* Delivered 217 million Rides (16% YoY growth)
* Maintained strong driver engagement with record driver hours

**Strategic Initiatives In Autonomous Vehicles**

Lyft announced significant partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space, positioning itself for future growth:

* Formed alliances with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar
* Plans to launch autonomous vehicle service in Atlanta by 2025

**Strategic Partnership with DoorDash**

* Established collaboration with DoorDash, the leading U.S. local delivery platform
* Introduced exclusive benefits for DashPass members using Lyft services

# WEAKNESSES AND CHALLENGES

* Secondary player to Uber (UBER) in the rideshare market, only 30% market share compared to Uber’s 70%.
* Doesn’t have the secondary revenue stream of Uber Eats to absorb fixed costs
* Smaller market share and geographic footprint
* Limited brand recognition internationally
* Heavy reliance on incentives to attract/retain drivers and riders
* High customer acquisition costs
* Competitive pressure on pricing

**Wall Street seems to like it as well**

“We think the strong after-hours move is deserved,” Sanderson adds, and think the results will ease concern about Lyft’s ability to grow profitably. “But management’s 15% multi-year \[gross bookings\] target will still be a debate, as will the company’s position for autonomous vehicles.”

“Efficiencies are driving EBITDA ahead of expectations, and the profitability of the rides business model shined, even through increased investment into rider/demand-based incentives,” Morgan Stanley’s Nowak added, raising his FY25/26 adjusted EBITDA estimates by 9% and 2%, respectively, contributing to a higher price target of $18 from $16, previously.

BofA Securities also lifted its price target, now at $19, as the company has “seemingly limited incremental share losses, focusing on core customers and commuters that are still growing order frequency.”

“We have a Buy rating on Lyft as tailwinds from mobility/transportation recovery in urban areas are outweighing risk factors like driver wage inflation, inflation’s impact on consumer travel, and competition risk from Uber and new autonomous entrants,” BofA’s Michael McGovern and Justin Post said in their research note.

**Continuing to accumulate for 3-5 years.**

Lyft has a long way to go, but the first and second quarter of adjusted operating profits in a row and strong cash flow generation suggest that it is a serious competitor to Uber.

I had recommended and started buying Lyft in October around $13-$14, calling it an attractive GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price), and a very reasonable valuation compared to Uber, which is unlikely to have a monopoly in the ride-sharing market.

Lyft deserves a seat at the table and with excellent Q3 results and raised guidance it looks even more compelling. Sure, there was a massive bump from $14 to $17. post earnings but the valuation is still attractive at 1.1x sales for 12-15% sales growth and at 17x earnings for a 15-17% grower.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

Why do some chapter 11s wipe out shareholders while some don’t ? ,"I know the majority of chapter 11’s will basically make stock value 0 and leave stock holders with nothing. However, in cases like American Airlines or Hertz they were able to keep equity for shareholders. I know these two examples are a bit different in that Hertz was able to raise money fast and AA was able to do a merger. Does this have to do with restructuring and whether or not they can reduce debt enough? Also what are the benefits of letting shareholders keep equity if they’re already filing for chapter 11?

"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check","**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;

Does ENPH still has a moat?,"Anyone who follows ENPH closely, or the solar industry in general, does ENPH still have a moat with their microinverters? 

Solar industry recently took a huge downturn with president elect, new competition, California, etc. But I'm still (bag)holding ENPH believing it will come back as long as it continues with its leading technology. While doing research, I remember most & if not all articles that wrote about ENPH mentioned microinverters as their moat; however, it's difficult to find anyone mentioning about it lately. I'm sure part of the earlier mentions had to do with hype, but am curious if they are losing their technical advantage over peers recently.

SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",25,22,1730585326.0,snowflakes stock buyback shortterm optimism,snowflake recently issued two billion dollars zeropercentinterest convertible senior notes due reflects high level confidence management investors companys shortterm growth potential heres breakdown move means snowflake might taking route cash debt issuance partially fund stock buyback program reducing number shares market often effect lifting stock price making shares scarcer buying back shares snowflake aiming support stock price short term potentially improving pershare earnings appealing investors take debt going toward share buybacks snowflakes move suggests theyre anticipating significant growth near future likely strong revenue demand data cloud services convertible notes carrying interest payments snowflake doesnt need worry traditional debt servicing costs investors instead receive option convert notes snowflake stock share price climbs level makes conversion profitable key detail notes conversion premium meaning investors would convert notes stock snowflakes price rises significantly current levels happens notes convert shares giving snowflake financial cushion without immediate dilution existing shareholders also implemented capped call transaction reduce risk dilution even stock convert later essentially move aligns highconfidence outlook snowflakes management seem believe theyll perform well enough short term drive stock price make financing favorable company strategy could provide snowflake flexibility acquisitions product investment even future stock debt issuances favorable terms market valuation continues rise bold move without risk snowflakes growth doesnt match expectations theyll taken significant debt without offsetting benefit higher stock price confidence expressed growth trajectoryparticularly competitive data marketis telling execute strategy effectively could smart way support stock preparing expansion
Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",16,16,1732898152.0,technology effect stock market average returns future hold higher average returns,know knowi know one knows market go sideways feel like live different world past numerous decades everyone access investing right palm hands virtually anyone anywhere invest market wish phone historical returns percent inflation adjusted based old technology processes access education finance longer days old tie wearing nyse brokers answer rotary phones screaming deals brokering deals end user whole process really needed someone strike deals cases suggest funds invest since internet self educate even research companies invest nowadays giants like fidelity vanguard others offering index funds take thought choice lot risk equation dont need ask broker sp fund buy dont need broker strike deals dont even need make call person anything crypto investor naysayer fact deny effect crypto investing done lot make investing mainstream even trendy always hedge funds major investors regular consumers taking part making retail much bigger player retail tripled almost instantly participation remained high almost hurdles removed investor investment technology little understandlearn done anywhere time convenience fan robinhood apps like put keys investing directly end users hands investing automatically diversified exceptionally well returning index funds palm everyones hand consider us stock market economic powerhouse world anyone anywhere part invest us stock market appealing anyone lesser financial climate japan wealth gluttons claws every last corner us government dont see anything moves bolster financial economic markets us stock market harvesting field elite wealth gluttons personal thoughts though said aware one predict stock market feels poised redefine average returns near future political climateif doesnt get completely blown unlikely think future returns far exceed percent long usa remains economic powerhouse
Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis. 

  
The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

I have 2000 shares in my Roth and in my trading account. Not financial advice but worth a look.

Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success.

Games Workshop up 15% following higher than expected quarterly sales!,"A few months ago I posted about Games Workshop and why I thought it was undervalued.  
TLDR: the new Space Marine II game was a hit and this would drive increased sales.

In the end, I decided to hold (thank God!)

Today GW announced significantly higher-than-expected quarterly sales, resulting in a 15% bump in stock price.

My hope is that this also makes an Amazon show deal more likely. This is clearly a popular and valuable IP and hopefully, this news will help get a deal over the line with Amazon.

I'm not sure if the stock is now fairly priced or still a little under-priced. I'd appreciate any community thoughts on this!

What your take on FMNA/FMCC?,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it’s a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally. 

Today’s sentiment by the trump administration is to release them from conservatorship. It could be a 20-50x pps jump next year.

Two questions about GOOG *vis a vis* GOOGL,"First, is there a legal/technical/business reason why the shares are split this way (voting and non-voting) in the first place?  This feels ridiculous, but I am often profoundly ignorant when it comes to stocks, so someone will probably point out why it's a good idea/required/a sacrifice to the gods/etc.

Secondly, I am at a loss as to why there is *ever* a significant gap between the two ... let alone one in favor of the non-voting shares.  The only two reasons I can think of is laziness and/or confusion.  It's like having two gas stations right next to each other sharing the same driveway, they should either be exactly the same price-per-gallon or so close that by the time you finish driving up to the cheaper option, the more expensive one has already moved its price downwards.",13,9,1731017513.0,two questions goog vis vis googl,first legaltechnicalbusiness reason shares split way voting nonvoting first place feels ridiculous often profoundly ignorant comes stocks someone probably point good idearequireda sacrifice godsetc secondly loss ever significant gap two let alone one favor nonvoting shares two reasons think laziness andor confusion like two gas stations right next sharing driveway either exactly pricepergallon close time finish driving cheaper option expensive one already moved price downwards

Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?

Liberty Media to spin off assets; CEO Greg Maffei to step down at year-end,">Liberty Media announced Wednesday it’s spinning off most assets besides Formula One auto racing into a separate publicly traded company, called Liberty Live, and that CEO Greg Maffei is stepping down at year-end. Chairman John Malone will become interim CEO of Liberty Media. Liberty Media’s investor day is set to take place on Thursday in Manhattan. After the split, Liberty Media will hold Formula One, which Liberty acquired in 2016 and later spun out as a tracking stock, and MotoGP, upon the closing of that transaction. Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

>The company also announced cable company Charter Communications  would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone’s portfolio. Liberty owns 26% of Charter shares. The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is expected to be completed in mid-2027. “The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,” Maffei said in a release.

>Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,” Maffei said in a separate release. “While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.” Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company’s assets, including Charter. Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the “cable cowboy,” and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He’s been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.

Tax Loss Harvesting,"Question regarding hedging with tax loss harvesting. What are the pros and cons of this strategy? What am I missing? 

Say I buy $50,000 worth of VOOG today. 

If it drops 6% and I sell, causing a $3k loss, I get to write that off on my taxes. Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Edit3: typos

So, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really ""dirt-cheap""?",10,51,1731659549.0,naive question intel awhat could go wrong,disclosure invested intel yet thinking ok know intel messed whatever get please challenge train thoughts intel got newest machines asml last year use like tsmc amd apple etc lunar lake combo intels design skills tsmcsasmls fab skills low margins latter however lunar lake turned pretty good intels design skills def intel everything inhouse could go wrong maybe intel need quite time catch fab capacity based asml machines get point competition amd longterm lower margins bc tsmc also slower timetomarket lower quantities qualcomm lower compat needs still resort issues arm nvidia capable need time good offer wont fab either face compat issues like qualcomm saying dealbreakers yeah speak intel org messed get ever restructured andor reorg expensive running money gov money time building fabs needs years zero euv experience low yields years edit intel lower market cap amd despite amd design inhouse assets gpu department insignificant compared something like nvidia talk igpus intel seem par edit would least new ceo give us bump could leave shortterm gains edit typos buying intel really risk dirtcheap pricing right really dirtcheap
Are the NANC and CRUZ tracking ETF’s a good investment you're implementing in your portfolio?,"With all the talk this election about congressional insider trading and looking at these various Saas and ETF options that follow US representative trades I was curious what y'all perspective was on these and if you're taking them seriously at all as a diversification play or if they are just kind of meme ETF's.

The NANC ETF aims to track the stock trades made by members of Congress and their spouses, focusing on trades involving Democratic members. As of September 30, 2024, NANC hit a one-year total return of about 40%, Whoa, which outpaces the S&P 500's gain of around 22% over the same period​.

On the other hand, the KRUZ ETF, which tracks trades by Republican members of Congress, has generally shown competitive returns but with less gains than NANC. 

Both ETFs seem to be a part of a broader trend in thematic investing that targets political market behavior which is interesting. Their management fees/expense ratio are both 0.75% which feels super high compared to like VOO (.03%).

These are both relatively new. And presumably could also be made obsolete if certain legislation passes that bans Congressional reps from investing while serving. 

Just wanted to get others take on these. Appreciate your time!

Investing in Modern Day Valuations,"Hi all! 

Long time lurker here (26M) who is looking for some general advice.

I do quarterly rebalancing for my personal portfolio, though I offset it slightly (mid-Feb, May, Aug, and Nov rather than the standard end-of-quarter timing). This past quarter was a strong one—I realized significant gains thanks to the market’s recent surge (up 98% YTD), which leaves me in a unique position as I plan my next moves.

Right now, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. The market feels extremely saturated, yet I also hesitate to sit on the sidelines or try to time a correction. I want to be thoughtful about redeploying my gains, but I’m not seeing many places to confidently put new money to work.

How are others in the community building conviction in their holdings? It feels like I keep hearing two extremes: either people are incredibly bullish, riding the wave, or they’re wary of a correction—yet staying fully invested in names like Costco, which is trading at a 56 P/E.

Any thoughts on finding balance in a market that feels a bit overheated? Or insights into areas with long-term value?",10,9,1731353520.0,investing modern day valuations,hi long time lurker looking general advice quarterly rebalancing personal portfolio though offset slightly midfeb may aug nov rather standard endofquarter timing past quarter strong onei realized significant gains thanks markets recent surge ytd leaves unique position plan next moves right im facing bit dilemma market feels extremely saturated yet also hesitate sit sidelines try time correction want thoughtful redeploying gains im seeing many places confidently put new money work others community building conviction holdings feels like keep hearing two extremes either people incredibly bullish riding wave theyre wary correctionyet staying fully invested names like costco trading pe thoughts finding balance market feels bit overheated insights areas longterm value
Celanese. Asking community's thoughts on a midcap industrial name.,"Hello, I hope a post like this is allowed.

I am looking at a company stock ticker CE. They are a chemicals company. The recent crash in share price is what prompted me to ""kick the tires"" on this name.

I am looking specifically at their balance sheet.

They have about 12B in long term debt. They made a big acquisition a few years back for about 10B. They essentially have 12B of bonds of which about 1B come due every year.

This year, they did not make enough money to pay off their bonds so they drew down 1B from their cash to pay off their bond. Now they only have 800m cash left. They anticipate that they cannot pay off their 2025 bonds and have already arranged short term financing to pay it off. Their debt coverage ratio is 1.4.

They are shutting down plants left and right to save money. They cut their dividend by 95%.

My question is simple. Considering the state of their finances (it's very bad not sugarcoating it), is this a good investment at current price? And if not, is there a price at which you would be interested?",9,7,1731165697.0,celanese asking communitys thoughts midcap industrial name,hello hope post like allowed looking company stock ticker ce chemicals company recent crash share price prompted kick tires name looking specifically balance sheet b long term debt made big acquisition years back b essentially b bonds b come due every year year make enough money pay bonds drew b cash pay bond cash left anticipate pay bonds already arranged short term financing pay debt coverage ratio shutting plants left right save money cut dividend question simple considering state finances bad sugarcoating good investment current price price would interested

TTEK $12 Billion contract ?,"Recently made an etrade account for savings/retirement and I've got a slow winter so I put $800 into a brokerage to play with and probably turn into $700 lol.  I'm aware that its just gambling and I've accepted the potential of losing all $800 i just wanna get some trading  experience have a little fun and maybe learn some stuff

First thing I did was buy some MCD during the Ecoli thing and sold it when it went back up (made $10) then I found this company Tetra Tech (TTEK) and bought 8 shares at $46. I did this because I saw they recently won a 12 billion contract with DLA as well as a couple other multi million dollar gov contracts. 

  
Price has gone up a little its only been a week or less but I'm confused am I totally misreading how stocks work. I would assume when a company starts making a ton of money the stock goes up. 

Obviously they havent earned that 12 billion yet but are these contracts not as concrete as they seem? Am I thinking stupidly about this? 

Another red flag is that in the last year it looks like the CEO and CFO have sold millions worth of shares.

Any advice would be much appreciated!",9,5,1731435106.0,ttek billion contract,recently made etrade account savingsretirement ive got slow winter put brokerage play probably turn lol im aware gambling ive accepted potential losing wan na get trading experience little fun maybe learn stuff first thing buy mcd ecoli thing sold went back made found company tetra tech ttek bought shares saw recently billion contract dla well couple multi million dollar gov contracts price gone little week less im confused totally misreading stocks work would assume company starts making ton money stock goes obviously havent earned billion yet contracts concrete seem thinking stupidly another red flag last year looks like ceo cfo sold millions worth shares advice would much appreciated

Looking for advice: combining technical analysis with news-based and high-volatility trading,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been trading more actively lately, focusing on high-volatility stocks and news-based opportunities. This year has been very successful for me. I’ve managed to achieve returns that were even above the S&P 500, so I’m really happy with my progress.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

Best way to get exposure to Mexico as an overall economy?,"Looking to lean a bit more towards betting on Mexico with the de-globalization and tariff trends.

Is there still runway for $TTWO?,"For disclosure: I bought in TTWO at a cost basis around 140 last November after the official announcement by Rockstar about GTA 6. I am not looking to hold the stock long-term, but rather capitalise on the short-term wave brought about by GTA 6. My initial exit was 180, but the stock has reached this level almost entirely by the post-election rally, without much accounting for the catalyst I initially had in mind.

I am extremely bullish about the materiality of GTA 6's release on TTWO. Investors were likely anxious if GTA 6 was still able to draw the same hype as its predecessors did, but the official trailer on 6 Nov last year proved so. It broke the world record for highest number of first-day views for a non-music video, and is now the most-liked game trailer of all time. In response, share price increased by 20% over the next month as the market geared for more news. I continue to believe GTA 6 will be wildly popular with the general public - drawing milennials for nostalgia's sake and Gen Z (and onwards) who finally have a GTA title of their own generation.

For comparison, GTA 5 sold 11m copies and 800m in revenue within the first 24 hours. Analysts expect GTA 6 to eclipse 1B revenue in the first day, which already equals an entire quarter's worth of revenue. I believe these estimates are rather conservative, given how far the console/PC gaming market has advanced over the past decade. It is reasonable to expect GTA 6 to be a complete sell-out given all the reasons above. 

Last week, management finally gave us visibility of a GTA 6 release in Fall of 2025. This is already a bit of a delay given that management had previously hinted at a ""significant inflection point"" in 1Q25 which I had read as at least a pre-release. Therefore, there is a material risk that the company further delays the launch again; or worse, the product is a let-down.

I am wondering, if you think that the GTA 6 momentum has already been fully priced in on fundamentals, or if there is still further upside.

Two potential undervalued gems - DLTR & DG,"I've been evaluating as most here the horrible jobs report and seeing the mag 7 flutter.. it made me investigate some tickers which have fell from grace.

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG).. 

Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.

Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.

Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money? 

First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession. 

We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

I could be wrong which is why I wanted to get everyone's perspective.

Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"I’ve been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP (BMO S&P 500 Index ETF) and VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Both track the S&P 500, which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the U.S. market, but I’m trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth.

On the surface, they look very similar: both are Canadian-domiciled ETFs that hold U.S. equities and are traded on the TSX. They both offer exposure to the same underlying index, so their holdings should be nearly identical. However, I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ:

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs. Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

**Tracking Error**: Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the S&P 500? Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other?

**Liquidity and Trading Spreads**: For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities, are there noticeable differences in the bid-ask spreads? Do they trade with similar liquidity, or does one tend to have an advantage?

**Currency Hedging**: From what I understand, neither of these funds is hedged to CAD. Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of?

**Dividend Treatment**: Both distribute dividends, but does one reinvest them differently or handle U.S. withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less tax-efficient?

**Historical Performance**: Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years? Even if minor, what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical?

Lastly, I’d love to hear what you personally use and why. Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa? Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty (Vanguard vs. BMO), or are there more practical considerations?

I'm also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio. If you’re holding one of these, are you pairing it with other U.S. exposure like QQQ, or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance?

Any insights, opinions, or anecdotes would be super helpful!

Diversifying my Portfolio (ASX),"Hey all,

I recently got into Stocks last week

I deposited so far $10k into VAS Top 300 AU, $10k into VGS International (This one has been underperforming also tempted to sell it for another international ETF which has less companies in it any recommendations on ETF's of this type to look into?, $10k into NDQ Tech 100, $2800 into CSL and $67k into the S&P500 (IVV)

(Made a mistake with the CSL because it hae a weighting of over 5% in VAS but I am not sure if its bad to sell it for another stock because Tax reasons? Can someone advise me if I should just leave it?

I constantly hear some people talk about just putting all or 99% into S&P500 and then I hear the opposite argument of needing to be diversified in not just US and AUS but also WW and also even at what percentages you should have in each Stock

Personally for this reason I did put some of my Stocks into AUS and WW (As per above) but because of the past think the returns on the S&P500 will be better hence why I have overweighted it (I know the past does not have to repeat iself) but my risk tolerance is somewhat high being married at 30 with no kids and wanting to make my first million ASAP but I am feeling like maybe I have far too high a weighting in the USA is my main question, and if I do with my remaining 50k is it worth sacrificing potential returns from S&P 500 to diversify more? i'd love opinions on this because current plan is just to go ham on the S&P500

It's like buying a 100's stocks that you think are decent but then going down the option chain and selling a 2-year contract with a strike price of a couple $ of or even cents over, knowing that the shares will be called away.

  
I know that obviously, there is the downside that your stock goes below and is more in the red than your premium. But say a company is trading at $4 right now, so $400 for 100 shares. and a 2 year contract call is at $5 strike at $250 premium.

Which sector etf would be a good hedge against inflation?,"Would the usual safe havens, like utilities, health care, gold, still do well with inflation?

What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?,"What am I misunderstanding about SPYI?

It is often recommended that investors just stick to ETFs such as SPY because it is very unlikely a person will out perform it with their own picks. If I am correct SPY has a like a 7%-8% return all time and closer to like 10% or higher in the last couple years. 
Anyway I see S&Ps high income ETF is just under 12% TTM. So does that mean if I have $100,000 I would get $11,950 in dividends a year? Wouldn’t this be higher than the growth and TTM combined SPY has? If so why wouldn’t everyone just invest in this and get 12% dividends a year?

My research and direction of McD,"I have already posted the my intro and intent on my first thread. Linking it here so I dont repeat myself.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtrdjh/my\_research\_and\_direction\_of\_abnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtrdjh/my_research_and_direction_of_abnb/)

  
**TLDR:** Short term short. I don't have an opinion on long term for this stock.

I will be entering the options route :  270 Put 17th Jan 2025.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

Can someone help me with my evaluation of a stock? ,"I never post, so i don't know how to refer to a thread, but i posted this in r/investing_discussion but without any succes.

So i have been trying to calculate companies i find interesting by dividing Total assets by Free Cash Flow. When i do this for the average company within the S&P500 i get insane values. Take PayPal for example. With a Total asset value of $82 Billion and divide it by $4.2 Billion in free cash flow = 19,5 years before you as the company owner earned it all back. that is close enough to the historical average, not too shabby.

However, when i do this for Wise PLC, i take $15,1 billion in total assets and divide it by $3,2 billion free cash Flow = 4,7 years...

But that's kinda low right? Am i doing something wrong?

Finding good mean reverting stocks,"I came to know that adf test and hurst exponent are useful to find the mean reverting stock. How true this is?
And if these tests are useful, is there any platform which can help me in performing these tests in an easy manner as currently I didn’t find any website to perform these tests and made my own method to perform the adf test which is very hectic.
How I’m performing the adf test:
1.Currently I’m downloading the historical data exporting it in an excel sheet.
2. Reading this file in the python and converting it into and array.
3. Using the adf function on the array and getting the results

This is a really hectic way and takes alot of time and energy. Haven’t made something similar for the hurst exponent yet as I don’t know whether these to tests will give me the mean reverting stocks or not.

I used chat gpt and it told me these to test to find out the stocks.

So I just want to know:
1. Whether these test will help me in finding mean reverting stocks or not.
2. If not, then how can I find them? What ways should I use?
3. If yes, then are these 2 test enough? And is there any platform which can help me perform these tests like just creating an excel sheet and uploading it into a tool and getting the results as this will be really helpful.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Need clarification on washsale,"Sorry in advance if this is confusing or not allowed but I'm trying to get clarification on my wash sale situation so I can get an idea on my taxes when the time comes.

So this year I've gotten into daytrading and have racked up a lot of wash sales. Overrall I've ended up net positive on my gains aside from alot of losses.

Are certificated shares ever *not* with a transfer agent?,"I am Per Rep in the estate of my deceased Dad who held on to paper stock certificates from the 1970s, which were part of his own inheritance. The stock is Federal-Mogul corporation. I have located the transfer agent, eqshareowners. I have learned that these are referred to as 'certificated shares'.

The certificated shares have not been altered like if they had been cancelled, like is common after they are converted. I have seen these since my childhood; there's no chance that they're fake. There's also the original receipt from his stock inheritance in his file.

I called eq shareowners and the process stops when they ask what his account number was. They ask for his last 5 of his ss#. We've gone over the date of purchase, shares and certificate numbers. The process comes to a screeching halt because of the lack of an account number.   There are other stocks in other accounts of his with eqshareowners, just not one for these 2. ""Without an account number, I cannot proceed with any information."" 

I have not found any paperwork or record of these shares ever being registered. Is it possible that these shares were never registered because they are very pre-internet? Am I calling and asking the wrong question? Do I need to call and ask *how to register them to create an account?*

I asked the agent if they were just recyclable paper then, but was told to hang on to them but couldn't tell me why.

Question about selling and purchase again in less than 30 days Taxes. ,"Hello, I have a question. If I buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $10 and then sell them for $6, can I use the $4,000 loss for tax purposes

How count this??? Loss $4000, Gain $3000 = -$1000

What would happen in that case? And if instead of selling it at $7, I hold it longer and end up selling it for more than the $10 I originally paid?

Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

Distribution of your assets between cash/stocks while the market is overvalued?,"It’s pretty clear that the market has hit insane valuations, and has already been discussed to death. My question is: have you all started to trim your stock positions for more cash to hedge risk of a market downturn, or will you continue to stay at the previous distribution you had prior to this years rally? For example, if you were 70% stock 30% cash/bonds prior to the bull market, have you adjusted your ratios in response to the current valuation (ex to 40% stock 60% cash) or stick with 70%/30%?

My personal strategy was extremely aggressive during the previous bear market (100% of my networth minus 10k for emergencies was in QQQ). I started trimming this after the valuations got higher and I am sitting around 70% stocks/30% cash currently.

(AHR) I’m back as promised; +44% since first post; senior living healthcare REIT sector outperforming; earnings release once again beat est.,"My first two posts: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/4OEM4c1Bq9

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/bKcUEjlglR

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day.

Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",0,23,1732810025.0,could coinbase enter sp dec rebalance think,coinbase global inc coin demonstrated significant growth meeting several key benchmarks considered sp index committee however performance closely tied cryptocurrency market particularly bitcoin correlation evident coinbases stock price often mirrors bitcoins fluctuations instance bullish bitcoin trends coinbase experiences increased trading volumes revenues leading higher stock valuations likely companies coinbase top inclusion rebalance forthcoming sp rebalance indeed indicative index committees perspective integrating companies like coinbase deeply embedded cryptocurrency sector inclusion company would signal significant shift towards embracing evolving financial landscape acknowledging growing prominence digital assets conversely opting include coinbase might suggest cautious approach reflecting concerns inherent volatility regulatory uncertainties associated crypto market therefore committees decision impact coinbase also serve broader statement acceptance digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices tradingview sp index committee employs specific criteria inclusion market capitalisation liquidity domicile public float financial viability coinbase may satisfy quantitative measures committee also exercises qualitative judgment considering factors like market stability companys role within industry corporate finance institute given coinbases substantial exposure volatile cryptocurrency market committee might deliberate potential risks associated volatility decision include company intertwined crypto sector would reflect committees stance evolving financial landscape readiness integrate digital asset platforms traditional indices summary coinbase appears meet fundamental requirements sp inclusion strong correlation bitcoin introduces considerations committee likely scrutinise balancing traditional financial principles dynamic nature cryptocurrency market

The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Nvidia Options Action 11/21: Confusion,"So I have 3 Nvidia calls: 160 11/29, 150 11/29, and 150 1/17/25.

"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works","There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

Chipotle (CMG) vs NVIDIA (NVDA) growth for 2025,"When both companies went through a stock split early this year (CMG was north of $3,000 and NVDA north of $1,200) I jumped on a few shares as both companies had tremendous growth.

Anyone else getting nervous about an impending recession?,"Prices feel inflated.  Tomorrow's prices are priced in today and as that continues every day at some point that logic ceases to be ""investing"" but rather ""speculation"" and thats the key-word behind every bubble.

If you've listened/read anything from the most successful investors, all the red flags they bring up are being seen now.   When EVERYONE is so optimistic is now whats making me most nervous.  If you read about major crashes and recessions of the past, they are always precipitated with quotes from investors about how if you're not in the market you're losing out and everythings looking great, future is great,

Tariffs will be inflationary.  Tax cuts will disproportionately favor big businesses.  Interest rates are going down because the fed is reactionary. All of these have the recipe for inflation to increase again but this time squeezing americans to the point where buying stops.  It will also induce a panic in the market that might trigger a large correction.   Trump wants to increase local production which will help in the short-run, but his foreign policy is unpredictable so hard to say what oil imports will do.

I think most people have some cautious optimism, but at what point does it become more caution than optimism?

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow.

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

Tejon Ranch could be the new st Joe or Howard Hughes,"$TRC - Tejon Ranch Co - 450m mkt cap

Tejon is one of the largest land holding companies in the US, owning 270,000 acres (1,093 km2) in California. its owns the tejon commerce center and is planning 3 new master planned comunities.

Stock has been crap over the last 10,20,30 years and board was very poor, horrible capital allocation and disproportionate salaries.

Can’t understate how important last week could be for Tejon as it starts its journey of improving shareholder relationships and path to unlocking value.

After months of pushing for a new board and CEO the first step was taken last week. 4 new board members including one agreed upon with with Nitor.

In my opinion TRC could be the new St Joe co or a target for Howard Hughes $HHH or bill ackman

Up to now TRC’s board was like a cemetary (no offense) 

average age of the board was above 80 and most people had been with the company for over 20 years..

* Top notch studios like Marvel, Pixar, 20th century, ABC. Sports network of ESPN.
* Theme parks in US, Paris, China, Tokyo. Cruise line (probably a cash burner).
* New CEO in early 2026, meaning.. plenty of time for Iger to look for a new job, leverage, armtwist whatever he has in mind.
* PE of 38 against 12 of Comcast.

Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"In my opinion, ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked. With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector. 

Side note: I believe that there is a super-intelligent species living in the ocean that we don’t know about yet. Let’s try to find them ;).

How is DCA in s&p500 such a superior strategy compared to other strategies around s&p500 investments?,"Hello,

So what I did was, take daily data of s&p500 for last 10 years.

"After being wrong about MBLY, BOFA doubles down: ""BofA Securities Trims Mobileye Global Price Target to $12 From $13""","Max pain for options on MBLY is misleading when we have over 20% of the float shorted and underwater, the smart ones closed when it was sold off, and then some trading professionals such as BOFA securities/their-friends/people-who listen-to-them, likely opened new shorts at the bottom and tried convincing others to follow their lead.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

Hertz Share Price Close To Half Book Value After Hitting an Expensive Undo Button,"Hertz made a big bet when it bought a ton of Tesla EVs for its fleet. The bet has not paid off in the slightest with higher maintenance costs than expected, an overstock of the EVs (especially considering how much they are rented out), and lower than expected resale value. 

This decision has put the company in a hole, where it’s now trading at close to half of its book value.

For TSLA is next options move ,"Last Friday's surge was clearly the result of an options Gamma Squeeze, in which a large number of people purchased call options, forcing the options market maker to buy shares, pushing the stock price further up, and then more people bought call options, and the options market maker was forced to buy more shares, and the process repeats itself!

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,"I believe there’s a common journey (or evaluation) of an investor. We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general, but we get better over time, as we accumulate knowledge and experience.

**Level 1: The Noob**

At this level, the focus is solely on the **share price and its past performance**. So, when the share price goes down from $100 to $30, the noob investor would conclude that now, the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do. Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory. There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse, and this decline could be justified. However, the noob investor isn’t aware that there are many questions that one should ask.

In addition, at this level, there’s a **tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others**, which is often times a really bad idea. However, without any knowledge and experience, the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart.

**Level 2: The Enthusiast**

The enthusiast has heard that **there’s more to investing than just the share price**. You’ve started exploring financial statements, and you’re learning the basics of accounting. **For the first time, the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement start making sense**. I’m sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant. It comes with a confidence boost, and it is normal to think “*Ah, I’ve got this investing thing figured out. It’s easy!*”

The catch is – even though it feels like a superpower, this is still the beginning. Financial statements provide information about what happened, not what will happen. Understanding them is useful, but not enough to be a great investor.

But at least now, you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others.

**Level 3: The Seeker**

This is where one is moving beyond the basics. Now you’ve learned that there are **various valuation techniques**, that allow you to figure out what a company is worth. It gets exciting! This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and P/E multiples, relative valuation, dividend discount model, and DCF. All of these can be powerful tools, and they’re one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not. At some point, you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you.

But here’s the problem. Having the tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. At this stage, it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that aren’t supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data. Basically, **garbage in – garbage out**. You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps.

However, it doesn’t feel that way. When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs, **it feels like a new superpower**, because in the end, there is an output. You have estimated the value of a company, and now you can compare that with the market price.

But, if your assumptions about growth rates, the discount rate, or margins are significantly off, your valuation is meaningless. In fact, there’s a chance it harms you more than it helps you.

By the way, everything that I’ve mentioned until now can be 100% automated. So, up until this level, you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm.

**Level 4: The Thinker**

At this point, you understand how important the inputs are.

Therefore, the focus shifts a bit more towards **understanding the industry, and the broader environment**, and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid.

For example, if you are analyzing a car company, you might want to understand if there’s a trend regarding EVs, if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins, if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity, etc.

This is when **research becomes your best friend**. You’re no longer just looking at the company in isolation—you’re connecting the dots between the company, its competitors, and the broader environment. Storytelling also becomes a part of your process, as now you’re not just crunching numbers—you’re building a narrative about the company’s future.

**Level 5: The Pro**

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play.

I don’t mean goodwill and patents. I mean **the management team and the company’s culture**. The key questions here are:

* Is the management trustworthy?
* What is its track record?
* What is its vision?
* Is there a culture that can survive tough times?

Culture is an often-overlooked factor in investing, but it’s incredibly important. As the saying goes, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company.

What I find interesting is, that if you are to invest in a private company, you’d get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies.

Here’s an example. Imagine someone walks up to you, and offers you to invest $10k in his company, and in exchange, you’ll have 10% of it. The first question that you’ll have is: Who is this person? If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior, misleading friends and family, and many failed ventures, you probably have your answer already, and the idea is irrelevant.

However, if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures, then you’d probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself. Your goal would be to understand the business, whether it can survive in the environment, and what return can you expect from it.

I hope you enjoyed this post and wish you great success on your investing journey! Do you recognize these levels in your own progression?

How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",0,29,1732236473.0,viking therapeutics inc brainer buy right,research really beleive stock gold viking therapeutics shared updates obesity treatment program vk obesityweek subjects achieved mean weight loss baseline placeboadjusted weight loss days daily dosing mg far concerned believe effective mounjaro demonstrated average weight loss approximately starting body weight weeks treatment also oral vk demonstrated favorable safety profile adverse events classified mild moderate oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments offering greater convenience lets look subcutaneous vk resultor like doses weekly subcutaneous injections led weight reductions baseline treated patients achieved weight loss compared placebo weight loss progressive throughout study plateau weeks obesity drug market projected grow billion offering significant upside vk also important size market hold many multiple big players analysts also predict viking could become takeover target due strong pipeline would boost price digits whats company also received praise liver disease treatment vk showed positive results phase b trial mash metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis serious liver condition affecting million americans reductions liver fat ranging weeks response rates reduction high far exceed typical benchmarks clinical data reinforce vks potential bestinclass obesity treatment effective weight loss strong safety durability results reason stock hasnt skyrocketed fear mongering market makers aftermath rfk junior far im concerned diabete liver diseases go away desperation ive seen patients obtain drug mad

How will inflate your debt away work in a country like US?,"I am trying to figure out if long term bonds are worth the risk in case future govt in collusion with Fed decides to keep rates low even if inflation is high.

Can anyone write play by play like how it may happen. I am going to try first below:

1. Say in 2025 inflation is still above 2.6% and economic activity points to strong labor market and GDP growth of 3% but still congress approves tax cuts for everyone at the cost of deficit. They also approve infrastructure projects costing trillions in deficit. But Fed continues to cut rates. Fed helps the govt fund it's deficit by buying treasury bonds if demand is low considering real yield is zero or negative.
2. Inflation goes much higher due to higher spending by businesses and consumers but Fed does not raise rates.
3. Say they tolerate inflation upto 5-6% while keeping short term rates at 3% or lower and forcing long term treasury rate below 4% because of fed buying them.

This will have the effect of debt being discounted every year by 2-3% just like how it has happened between 2020 to 2023.

I have seen developing countries like India tolerate inflation level of 10-12% every year resulting in their debt value getting reduced by 90% in 15-20 years, while their GDP keeps growing.

","MBLY (Mobileye) is the leader in autonomous driving technology supplying automakers. Elon will push Trump to encourage the expansion of autonomous driving for his Tesla Full Self Driving and robotaxis. Only three companies can do full autonomous driving: Tesla, Google’s Waymo, and Mobileye. Automakers will have to respond and they aren’t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY.

MBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day, we may get more announcements. A year from now, all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY.

Each customer like Volkswagen is \~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP). MBLY’s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028, MBLY’s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today. Meanwhile the stock is on lows due to near-term noise around weak total auto units industry wide, etc, creating a great entry point.

$MBLY is my next 10 bagger.

Is the S&P 500 too high? ,"Bit of a broad topic but the S&P is at an all time high. I'm concerned that something might happen within the next year that might erase all my gains. The market feels overvalued, but at the same time, I wonder if it’ll keep climbing considering Trump's policies. 

I missed some good opportunities this year because I thought prices were already too high and don't want to miss out again. Not trying to time the market, just trying to figure out what happens next considering the political environment. What’s everyone’s take? Are you buying and holding?

US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

Google stock thoughts ," think that google depends on Apple , if apple products fail, or if apple partner with another search engine then Google would fail

Edge and Bing are really good now , comes installed in 80% of the machines sold , if its good enough why bother downloading chrome ? and Bing looks almost exactly the same as google , 

Chrome Os is failing also, Android might get antitrust..

Why I think UBER is a BUY,"**Personal trading context:**

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.
